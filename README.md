IntentKit is an open-source, self-hosted cloud Agent cluster that manages a collaborative Agent team for you.

## Why IntentKit

Current AI agents follow two paths: one is Local First, like OpenClaw, which can serve as your toy or assistant. Running it requires an expensive physical device, and the permissions it has enable it to do many things. The other is like all the other web apps you use—it runs in the cloud, needs few resources, requires no maintenance from you, and can more reliably complete your tasks. If you want this kind, try IntentKit.

## Features

- ☁️ Cloud-Based, Ultimate Resource Savings
- 🤖 Multiple Mutually Callable Agents
- 🔄 Everything Out of the Box
- 🔗 Optional Crypto-Friendly Integration
- 🐦 Social Media Integration
- 🛠️ Extensible Skill System

## Documentation

Check out [Documentation](docs/) before you start.

## Deployment

Read [Deployment Guide](docs/content/en/deployment) to get started with your setup.

## Other Use Case

Besides self-deploying IntentKit, here are other ways to use this project:

- IntentKit is actually a Python library that you can import and extend, or use to add Agent cluster support to your existing projects.
- Regardless of the deployment method, each individual Agent can enable its own API, allowing you to call that Agent from other projects. [Agent API Documentation](docs/content/en/docs/others/agent_api.md)
